\section{Introduction} 
Transportation models are a type of linear programming problem that deals with the distribution of goods from several suppliers to several consumers. The objective is to minimize transportation costs while satisfying supply and demand constraints.

\subsection{Methods:}
1. Northwest Corner Method
2. Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM)
3. Least Cost Method

\section{Optimal Solution}
The optimal solution in transportation problems can be found using the following methods:
\subsection{Optimal solution methods:}
1. Stepping Stone Method
2. Modified Distribution Method (MODI)
